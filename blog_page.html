                <strong>This is how legends are born.</strong>
                <br><br>
                <div class="blogText">
                <p>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (Brazilian Portuguese: [nejˈmaʁ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ ˈsɐ̃tus ˈʒũɲoʁ]; born 5 February 1992), known as Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. He is widely considered as one of the best players in the world.</p>
            
                <p>Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 for his performances. He then attained a domestic double in the 2015–16 season. In 2017, Neymar transferred from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in a move worth €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever.[note 1] In France, Neymar won three league titles, a Coupe de France, and a Coupe de la Ligue, which included a domestic treble and being voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year, in his debut season.[9]</p>
            
                <p>With 61 goals in 101 matches for Brazil since debuting at age 18, Neymar is the third highest goalscorer for his national team, trailing only Pelé and Ronaldo. He was a key player in Brazil's victories at the 2011 South American Youth Championship, where he finished as leading goalscorer, and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he won the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. His participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa América was cut short by injury and a suspension, respectively, but, the following year, he captained Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football at the 2016 Summer Olympics, and two years later, featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.</p>
            
                <p>Off the pitch, Neymar ranks among the world's most prominent sportsmen; SportsPro named him the most marketable athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013, and ESPN cited him as the world's fourth-most famous athlete in 2016. In 2017, Neymar was included by Time in its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[10] By 2018, France Football ranked Neymar the world's third highest-paid footballer, and in 2019, Forbes ranked him the world's third highest-paid athlete.[11]</p>

            <strong>Greatest of  all time</strong>
            <br><br>
            <div class="blogText">
            <p>Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi (born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine footballer who plays for FC Barcelona and captains the Argentina national team, mainly as an forward. Messi received several Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations by the age of 21, and won in 2009 and 2010. His playing style and small stature has drawn comparisons to Diego Maradona, who himself declared Messi as his "successor."</p>
        
            <p>Messi began playing football at a young age and his skill and potential was soon realized by Barcelona. He left Rosario-based Newell's Old Boys's youth team in 2000 and moved with his family to Europe, as Barcelona offered treatment for his growth hormone deficiency. Making his debut in the 2004–05 season, he broke his team record for the youngest footballer to score a league goal. Major honours soon followed as Barcelona won La Liga in Messi's debut season, and won a double of the league and Champions League in 2006. His breakthrough season was in the 2006–07 season; he became a first team regular, scoring a hat-trick in El Clásico and finishing with 14 goals in 26 league games.</p>
        
            <p>Messi has won five La Liga titles, three Champions League titles, scoring in two of those finals, against Manchester United in both 2009 and 2011. He was not on the pitch as Barcelona defeated Arsenal in 2006, but received a winners' medal from the tournament. After scoring 12 goals in the 2010–11 Champions League, Messi became only the third player (after Gerd Müller and Jean-Pierre Papin) to top-score in three successive European Champion Clubs' Cup campaigns. However, Messi is the first one to win the Champions League top scorer titles for three consecutive years after Champions League changed its format in 1992..</p>
        
            <p>Messi was the top scorer of the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship with six goals, including two in the final game. Shortly thereafter, he became an established member of Argentina's senior international team. In 2006, he became the youngest Argentine to play in the FIFA World Cup and he won a runners-up medal at the Copa América tournament the following year. In 2008, in Beijing, he won his first international honour, an Olympic gold medal, with the Argentina Olympic football team. At international level Messi has scored 19 goals in 66 games.</p>

            <strong>CR7</strong>
            <br><br>
            <div class="blogText">
                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, popularly known by his nickname ‘CR7’ is a Portuguese professional football player. He plays forward for Juventus (Italian club) and the Portugal National Team. Among the greatest of all time to have graced the football pitch, entertaining us with a unique style of play, outstanding dribbles, sensational goals and electrifying speed, Cristiano Ronaldo stands out. The ace skipper has a penchant for scoring incredible goals while inspiring his team to victory. Ronaldo emboldens the perfect definition of winning. We take a close look into the life of this football star who is regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time on the planet in our Cristiano Ronaldo biography facts, childhood, career and personal life.</p>
            
                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985. He was the fourth child born to his mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro and his father, Jose Dinis Aveiro in Funchal, an island of Madeira, Portugal. His father worked as a metropolitan gardener while his mother was a cook. Ronaldo was named after then-US President Ronald Reagen. Ronaldo has an elder brother, Hugo and older sisters, Elma and Liliana. While growing up, he and all his siblings shared a room. Ronaldo was raised as a Catholic. He played for an amateur team, Andorinha, before being signed by Sporting CP for 1,500 Euros after a three-day trial. Ronaldo stopped attending school so as to focus on his football career. Prior to that decision, he was expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher. His football dreams were threatened by a racing heart condition, but after undergoing surgery he resumed playing</p>
            
                <p>Ronaldo earned his place in the youth team of Sporting CP at the age of 16, after he was promoted by the first-team manager. Ronaldo became the first sporting CP player to play in the under-16, under-17, under-18, B-team and first team in a season. Ronaldo’s representative spoke with then-Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier and Barcelona president, Joan Laporta on signing him. Arsenal Manager also met with Ronaldo to discuss a possible transfer. Alex Ferguson was impressed by Ronaldo’s performance in a 3-1 defeat of Manchester United in August 2003. Ferguson was further pressurized to sign him permanently after United plan to sign him for a year before loaning him back to Sporting CP. Sporting was paid 12.24 million pounds in exchange for him.</p>
            
                <p>Ronaldo is known to be a philanthropist. In 2004, he visited Indonesia to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction after TV footage showed a boy whose parent had been killed in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and had been stranded for 19 days. In 2012 he and his agent paid for the treatment of a nine-year-old Canarian boy with terminal cancer. He sold his 2011 golden boot for 1.5 million euros to fund schools in Gaza. In August 2016, he launched the CR7Selfie app, a selfie app for charity to aid Saving of children.</p>

            <strong>Brian Glanville : Liverpool Put In Dominant Performance Against Man United.</strong>
            <br><br>
            <div class="blogText">
                <p>This has been a triumphant season for Liverpool, fully 16 points ahead of second-placed Manchester City in the Premier League and with a game in hand. All credit to the team and to their resourceful manager Jurgen Klopp who is the very epitome of an almost superstitious caution. </p>
            
                <p>“Everyone should celebrate the situation apart from us”, he declares. “Nothing has changed… I will tell you immediately the moment it feels different, but at the moment it doesn’t. We will not be part of that party yet but it’s no problem. We know our job… I have to keep myself concentrated even in the interviews. That is the truth.</p>
            
                <p>But what small hope is there for anybody to catch this dominant Liverpool team? In their captain and centre-back Virgil Van Dijk they have a player both dominant and inspirational. He gave a display of faultless composure in the heart of his defence. He it was who majestically scored his team’s first imposing goal after 14 minutes, dashing past three opponents to head the corner from Alexander-Arnold high into the goal.</p>
            
                <p>It seemed pretty clear that the die was cast. Not even the battle-hardened Harry Maguire could do anything about it. His team’s second did not come until three minutes into injury time when the elusive Salah scored it but by that belated time it was well deserved. By half-time, Liverpool had ruled the game. Another goal should surely have come to Liverpool right at the start of the second half when Salah failed to score from six yards, and Jordan Henderson shot against a post from the edge of the box.</p>
